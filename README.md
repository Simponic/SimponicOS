##SimponicOS

This is a 32-bit protected mode operating system that I am scrapping together.
Hopefully it turns into something cool.

You must have the GCC toolchain compiled for i386 installed on your machine, setup
with cross-compilation. You can find directions on how to do this on the OSDev
wiki.

You must also have grub, as I use it for bootloading.
