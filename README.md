##SimponicOS

This is a 32-bit protected mode OS that I am trying to write from scratch.
It is mostly a test of my knowledge of C and computer hardware in general.
I hope it becomes something better in the future. Right now I'm having
difficulty with interrupts.

You must have the GCC toolchain compiled for i386 installed on your machine, setup
with cross-compilation. You can find directions on how to do this on the OSDev
wiki.

You must also have grub, as I use it for bootloading.
